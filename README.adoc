== TLDR Quick Start

The main thing missing is a process for setting up a fresh install.  For now, you can just ask for a copy of the database from https://gitlab.com/thosmos[@thosmos]

=== Ensure you have a Java JDK
```
javac -version
```

=== Install Clojure CLI

Install Clojure CLI on Mac OS:
```Shell
brew install clojure
```
Other OS: https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started

=== Admin UI
```Shell
# Load all JS deps from package.json.
yarn
(npm install)

# Start up the client UI compiler (watches the code and hot-reloads the browser on changes):
yarn main
```

=== Datomic

Download Datomic Free https://my.datomic.com/downloads/free
```
unzip datomic-free-0.9.5703.21.zip
cd datomic-free-0.9.5703.21

# Get the data zip from a project member
unzip ../riverdb-backup-data.zip

# if you're using JDK 1.8, then just:
bin/transactor config/samples/free-transactor-template.properties

# otherwise you'll need to override the PATH and JAVA_HOME to use 1.8:
PATH=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_172.jdk/Contents/Home/bin:$PATH JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_172.jdk/Contents/Home/  bin/transactor config/samples/free-transactor-template.properties
```
(or Datomic Pro if you wish https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/dev-setup.html)

=== Backend Server

Change some defaults using environment variables like `DATOMIC_URI` in an `.env` file or in the shell (the following are the defaults)
```
APP_ENV=dev
DATOMIC_URI=datomic:free://localhost:4334/riverdb
PORT=8989
```

run the server:
```
clojure -A:server:run
```

OR start the server in a REPL:
```Shell
clj -A:dev:server

# The ns is defined in src/dev/user
## Start the server
user=> (start)
## After modifications of the backend code:
user=> (restart)
```



Browse to the app at: http://localhost:8989


=== The client build server

Optionally open the http://localhost:9630[client build manager UI]
There you can recompile or trigger release builds

//http://localhost:8989[Main App] (http://localhost:8989)
//http://localhost:8022[Tests] (http://localhost:8022)
//http://localhost:8023[Workspaces] (http://localhost:8023)

=== Clojurescript REPL:

You can execute CLJS code in a REPL running in the browser environment

. Open a remote nREPL to http://localhost:9000[localhost:9000]
. Execute `(shadow/repl :main)`
. Test with `(js/alert "Hello from the CLJS REPL")`


== A More Detailed Setting Up Description ...

The shadow-cljs compiler uses all js dependencies through
NPM. If we use a library that is in cljsjs we will also have to add
it to our `package.json`.

You cannot compile this project until you install the ones it
depends on already:

```
$ yarn
```

or if you prefer `npm`:

```
$ npm install
```

Adding NPM Javascript libraries is as simple as adding them to the
`package.json` file and requiring them! See the
https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_javascript[the Shadow-cljs User's Guide]
for more information.

Dependency Aliases:

You will want to enable the `:dev` and `:server` Clojure dependencies while developing the server-side of this project.  In IntelliJ this is in the
"Clojure Deps" border tab window under "Aliases".

The client and common project source is in `src/main`.
The server project source is in `src/server`.

== Development Mode

Shadow-cljs handles the client-side development build. The file
`src/main/app/client.cljs` contains the code to start and refresh
the client for hot code reload.

In general it is easiest just to run the compiler in server mode:

```
$ npx shadow-cljs server
INFO: XNIO version 3.3.8.Final
Nov 10, 2018 8:08:23 PM org.xnio.nio.NioXnio <clinit>
INFO: XNIO NIO Implementation Version 3.3.8.Final
shadow-cljs - HTTP server for :test available at http://localhost:8022
shadow-cljs - HTTP server for :workspaces available at http://localhost:8023
shadow-cljs - server version: 2.7.2
shadow-cljs - server running at http://localhost:9630
shadow-cljs - socket REPL running on port 51936
shadow-cljs - nREPL server started on port 9000
...
```

then *navigate to the server URL* (shown in this example as http://localhost:9630) and
use the *Builds* menu to enable/disable whichever builds you want watched/running.

Shadow-cljs will also start a web server for any builds that configure one. This
template configures one for workspaces, and one for tests:

- Workspaces (MUST RUN SERVER): http://localhost:8989/wslive.html
- Tests: http://localhost:8022

You can also run the individual client builds directly
```Shell
#### Develop components with cljs ####
# Workspaces:
npm run client/workspaces
```
Visit http://localhost:8023
Have a look at src/workspaces and https://github.com/nubank/workspaces

```
#### Refreshing tests in the browser ####
# CLJS Tests:
npm run client/test
```
Visit http://localhost:8022

```
#### Full-stack development ####
# Start the cljs compiler for the main target  (server must be running)
npm run client/main
```
Visit http://localhost:8989

See the server section below for working on the full-stack app itself.

=== Client REPL

The shadow-cljs compiler starts an nREPL. It is configured to start on
port 9000 (in `shadow-cljs.edn`).

In IntelliJ: add a *remote* Clojure REPL configuration with
host `localhost` and port `9000`.

then:

```
(shadow/repl :main)
```

will connect you to the REPL for a specific build (NOTE: Make sure you have
a browser running the result, or your REPL won't have anything to talk to!)

If you're using CIDER
see https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_cider[the Shadow-cljs User's Guide]
and the comments in `deps.edn` for more information.

=== The API Server

In order to work with your main application you'll want to
start your own server that can also serve your application's API.

Start a LOCAL clj nREPL in IntelliJ (using IntelliJ's classpath with
the `dev` alias selected in the Clojure Deps tab), or from the command line:

```bash
$ clj -A:dev:server
user=> (start)
user=> (stop)
...
user=> (restart) ; stop, reload server code, and go again
user=> (tools-ns/refresh) ; retry code reload if hot server reload fails
```

Some options can be set on the command line or in the deps.edn under the :dev alias:

The `-J-Dtrace` adds a JVM argument that will enable performance tracing for Fulcro Inspect's network tab so you can
see how your resolvers and mutations are performing.

The `-J-Dguardrails.enabled=true` turns on guardrails instrumentation of guardrails spec'd functions, which is a wrapper
of Clojure spec that makes instrumentation and production-time elision (for performance and size) much easier.

NOTE: For real development, please use an editor that has REPL integration, like Cursive (recommended), Atom Chlorine, or
Spacemacs.

The URL to work on your application is then
http://localhost:8989

Hot code reload, preloads, and such are all coded into the javascript.

=== Preloads

There is a preload file that is used on the development build of the
application `riverdb.development-preload`. You can add code here that
you want to execute before the application initializes in development
mode.

=== Fulcro Inspect

Fulcro inspect will preload on the development build of the main
application and workspaces.  You must install the plugin in Chrome from the
Chrome store (free) to access it.  It will add a Fulcro Inspect tab to the
developer tools pane.

== Tests

Tests are in `src/test`. Any test namespace ending in `-test` will be auto-detected.

```
src/test
└── app
    └── sample_test.cljc          spec runnable by client and server.
```

You can write plain `deftest` in here, and it is preconfigured to support the helper macros in `fulcro-spec` as well.

=== Running tests:


==== Clojure Tests

Typically you'll just run your tests using the editor of choice (e.g. Run tests in namspace in IntelliJ).

The tests are also set up to run with Kaocha at the command line for your convenience and CI tools:

```
$ clj -A:dev:clj-tests --watch
```

See the https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[Kaocha project] for more details.

==== Clojurescript tests

The tests can be run in any number of browsers simply by navigating to the test URL that shadow-cljs outputs.

CI support is done through the `ci-test` build in shadow, and via Karma.

If you start the `ci-tests` build in Shadow-cljs, then you can also run cljs tests in a terminal "watch mode"
with:

```
npx karma start
```

Of course, this make CLJS CI easy:

```
npx shadow-cljs compile ci-tests
npx karma start --single-run
```

==== Running all Tests Once

There is a UNIX Makefile that includes all of the CI commands as the default target. Just run:

```
make
```

== Workspaces

Workspaces is a project by Nubank that is written in Fulcro, and has great support for developing in
Fulcro. It is similar to devcards but has a more powerful user interface, integration with Fulcro Inspect,
and much more.

The source directory for making additions to your workspace is `src/workspaces`.

IMPORTANT: Any namespace ending in `-ws` will be auto-detected and added to your workspace!

== Standalone Runnable Jar (Production, with advanced optimized client js)

See tools deps projects like Depstar. You'll need to make a release js build, optionally
pre-compile your CLJ, and package it.  We will likely add a demo of this process soon.
